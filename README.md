# Comparing-forecasting-methods
This code helps you to compare your forecasting methods such as linear regression, and decision tree, ... to find out which one is better according to your data
well you can compare your methods in several ways such as:
1.Cross-validation
2.Visual inspection
3.Regularization
4.Out-of-sample testing
In the first method you compare the MSE error of your different methods such as linear regression,	Polynomial Regression,	Decision tree,	Decision Tree Regressor model,	Gradient Boosting Regressor,	Random Forest Regressor,	Neural Networks,	Support Vector Machines (SVM), and	Time Series Models which I talk about them in Modeling-and-forecasting page.
In the second one, you will compare the base of the method on the scatter plot of predicted-actual data. The third method says you should use regularization techniques if you use complex methods such as polynomial degree high.
The last method suggests using an extra test dataset to find the accuracy of your methods.
